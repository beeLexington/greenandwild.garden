    <h2>Agreement</h2>
    <p>
        By agreeing for me to commence work for you, you are agreeing to these
        Terms of Service. It is your responsibility to read and understand them
        in full before agreeing to use my services and any such agreement will
        be considered to implicitly include an agreement to these Terms of
        Service in full.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am happy to answer any questions you might have about these Terms of
        Service at any time.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="consultation">
    <h2>Consultation</h2>

    <p>
        Before agreeing to start working with you, I will usually meet with you
        to understand and discuss your needs and expectations and to explain how
        I will work with you. This will usually involve a site visit, during
        which I will usually take photos and record measurements.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="pricing">
    <h2>Pricing & fees</h2>

    <p>
        As part of the consultation process, I will inform you of the price you
        will pay for my services. This will either be an hourly rate or a fixed
        fee at my discretion.
    </p>
    <p>I will not charge for the consultation process.</p>
    <p>
        Payment will be collected and due immediately at the end of each visit
        unless I specifically and explicitly specify otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        I accept the following payment methods: cash, credit or debit card, or
        bank transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am able to send you a receipt by email or text message, and if I have
        an email address on record for you, I will send receipts by email unless
        you request otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
        I reserve the right to discontinue ongoing services for you with no
        notice in the event of an inability or failure to pay for services I
        have carried out, or any other chargeable costs associated with my work
        for you, until all outstanding payments are made.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="chargeable-time">
    <h2>Chargeable time</h2>

    <p>
        Unless specifically and explicitly agreed otherwise, I charge for all of
        the time I am on site. This includes all time spent setting up at the
        beginning of my visit and packing up at the end. I also charge for time
        spent doing research or making plans for your space while off site.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I am on site, I will focus entirely on the services I am carrying
        out for you, with the exception of setting up and packing up and any
        breaks I take. If I need to take more than 5 minutes of breaks in any 1
        hour period for any reason, I will not charge for the time in excess of
        5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        If I need to go off site in order to carry out my duties for you, for
        example to visit a garden centre to purchase materials for use in your
        garden, I will charge for the entire duration of my time off site
        carrying out work on your behalf, including any travel time.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="materials">
    <h2>Materials</h2>

    <p>
        All materials to be used while working for you must either be provided
        by you or you must reimburse me for any costs associated with acquiring
        them for you, including but not limited to the purchase cost of the
        materials, VAT, and any shipping and handling fees.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="mileage">
    <h2>Mileage</h2>

    <p>
        I reserve the right to charge for mileage for any journey associated
        with the work I carry out for you at the standard rate of Â£0.45 per
        mile.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will never charge for both mileage and travel time for the same
        journey.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="cancellation">
    <h2>Withdrawal & cancellation</h2>

    <p>
        At any point during or following the consultation, but before I have
        commenced work with you, you will have the opportunity to withdraw from
        my services at no cost.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once I have started work, you may withdraw from my services by informing
        me in writing. You will owe me for any work I have done for you up until
        that point. If we agreed a fixed fee and I have not completed the work
        set out to be covered by that fee, you will owe me the lesser of the
        fixed fee and the total time I have spent so far, charged at my standard
        hourly rate at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I will make every effort to honour my agreements with you, I
        reserve the right to discontinue my services for you at any time for any
        reason, charging for any work already carried out or any other costs
        already incurred by you.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will endeavour to provide you with at least 48 hours notice before
        cancelling any appointments I have with you, and expect you to do the
        same.
